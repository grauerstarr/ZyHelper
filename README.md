# Install
Put the ZyHelperBetaAdapter.cs file into folder Zy in your TurboHUD plugins.

Put the .exe file somewhere.

Start Zyhelper then start TurboHUD. You always have to start them in this order (otherwise the helper might not work).

If that does not just work, check if Helper and THUD are connected, by looking at the second checkbox under "Active".

If its not checked there is no connction to TH. Check your firewall settings if it blocks THUD or Zyhelper (ZyHelper uses a TCP/IP connection to communicate with THUD).

# How to use
For non-wizard:

Check the skills you want to cast and give it the right hotkeys. L = leftclick; R = rightclick.

for Wizard:

Check Archon if you want Archon Macro (Bazooka), Check Blackhole if you want old Blackhole Macro (Season 15 style). 

For Archon Star Pact do NOT check Black Hole, but put in the right hotkeys.

Hold down 5 to shoot. If you have enough time the helper will shoot a meteor to spawn an occulus. If there is not enough time, it will go straight to the Archon Impact.

The toggle version of the macro does not work with Archon Macro, only with the old Macro. 

For the Archon macro you have to press electrocute yourself. This is so you can move into oculus easily.

You can just hold down both buttons while shooting.

On Necro:

If there is an elite within 70 yards Mages only autocast if you actually target the elite. 

SecondSim casts simulacrum 10s into the rift.

Press F10 to pause the helper entirely (turns off all autocasts and disables the mage macro). You can press F10 again to resume.
